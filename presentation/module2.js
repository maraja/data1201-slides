              Benjamin Parker, ‚ÄúUncle Ben‚Äù to Spiderman‚Äôs alter ego Peter
              Parker, reminds us that, ‚ÄúWith great power comes great
              responsibility. As data promises to fundamentally change the way
              we do business, we must also step back and consider our
              obligations to society at large. If a user requests to have their
              data removed, do we have an obligation to remove it? If law
              enforcement seeks unfettered access to our data, do we have an
              obligation to provide it? The practical issue is how to balance
              concerns like privacy and security with the data needs of the
              organization. <br />
              <br />
              Despite our best intentions, balancing these concerns is often
              dictated by technology constraints. While we may wish to allow
              users to delete content, it may be impossible to update every
              instance of that content. There may still be data backups that
              contain the removed data ‚Äì can we delete from those backups?
              Perhaps it will take a few hours for the deletion to take full
              effect ‚Äì do we allow access to records that may have the removed
              content? Often what our technology is capable of determines what
              services we can provide to society. <br />
              <br />
              We are also constrained by people‚Äôs biases. People will bring
              their own experiences, which may lead to incorrectly interpreting
              the data. These biases might lead to incorrect decisions that
              negatively affect society. Company decision makers that believe
              women are worse engineers than men may cite data showing women
              engineers have lower performance scores than their male
              counterparts. But is this because women are worse engineers or
              because the company creates a toxic work environment for women?
              How do we balance the need to honestly report the data we have
              against potential harms when people choose to use the data in a
              negative way? <br />
              <br />
              In this module, we explore questions related to the technology
              constraints and our obligations to society. We will frame this
              module and future ones, in terms of the Data Value Chain. The Data
              Value Chain is a series of steps and processes that occur between
              the data being generated and a business decision. Each step in the
              chain brings technological and societal questions ‚Äì answers to
              which may often be at odds.

          <T5 textColor="secondary">
            A transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database
            management system (or similar system) against a database, and
            treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other
            transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in a
            database.

              Example: Direct deposit of your pay check is atomic. Money is
              debited from your employers account and credited to yours.
              <br />
              <br />
              Example: Receiving pain medication in the hospital is atomic. The
              pain medication is removed from the hospital inventory and added
              to your medical record.

          <T5 textColor="secondary">
            An atomic transaction is an indivisible and irreducible series of
            database operations such that either all occur or nothing occurs. A
            guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring
            only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the
            whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be
            observed to be in progress by another database client. At one moment
            in time, it has not yet happened, and at the next it has already
            occurred in whole (or nothing happened if the transaction was
            cancelled in progress).

              <br />
              Example: When you received pain medication in the hospital, both
              the hospital inventory and your medical record shows the
              administration of the drug.

          <T5 textColor="secondary">
            Consistency in database systems refers to the requirement that any
            given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed
            ways. Any data written to the database must be valid according to
            all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and
            any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness of the
            transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted
            (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely
            that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any
            defined rules.

              <br />
              Example: When you are involved in an auto accident, your insurance
              company will fill in your information. The information about the

                  This module introduced the Data Value Chain and discussed many
                  of the technical and ethical issues to address in each step.
                  Sometimes balancing the two comes down to making business
                  trade-offs; sometimes there are more fundamental limitations.
                  A key first step in Data Management is defining the technical
                  and societal concerns upfront, then explore ways to achieve a
                  balance. <br />
                  <br />
                  In the following modules, we will look at concrete solutions
                  to many of the questions raised in this module. The next
                  module will look at the history of data collection and
                  management: what problems have been encountered in the past
                  and how have they been dealt with.
